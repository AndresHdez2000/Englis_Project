      <h2>Why is war part of their culture?</h2>
      <p>The U.S.A. has been fighting wars since their independence, and it does
         not mean that have a culture of war is bad, because they don't let others
         push them, however, sometimes they get involved in too many and they seem
         to be a violent Country as consequence.</p>

        <h3>Mexican-American War<br>1846 - 1848</h3>
        <p>This war did hurt the Mexican's proud because thanks to the expansionist-mind of
          the president from the U.S.A. had, and the lack in Mexico, they started to send people to
          Texas so they can start fighting. By winning this war, Texas started to form part of the

        <h3>Vietnam War<br>1955 - 1975</h3>
        <p>The Vietnam War was one of the most difficult fights that the U.S.A. has fought, this because
           they spend a lot of resources because it was a very long war, the world didn't support the idea
           because the Cold War was in the climax of its tension. The communists ended the war by seizing the territory.</p>

        <h3>World War I<br>1914 - 1918</h3>
        <p>The U.S.A. joined this war in 1917, when the German Army impacted one of their submarines, so they
          decided to join the Allied Power. This conflict took a lot of lives, but the impact of the lack
          of resources gave the women the opportunity of achieving the right to vote.</p>

        <h3>World War II<br>1939 - 1945</h3>
        <p>The participation of the U.S.A. took place in 1941, when Italy, Germany, and Japan unify their power in order
           to win the war, despite they were winning president Roosevelt, and the congress stated that there wasn't honor
           in their fight because they attacked Pearl Harbor. The creation of the Atomic Bomb, better named by the name of "Little Boy", which was dropped in
           Hiroshima and Nagasaki finished the war. </p>

        <h3>Civil War<br>1861 - 1865</h3>
        <p>The Civil War was necessary at that time, and for the world, it was an important taken step, because before
          the civil war, black people just objected that you could trade with, and after this War, black people
          could start to get the freedom they deserve just like any other human.</p>
